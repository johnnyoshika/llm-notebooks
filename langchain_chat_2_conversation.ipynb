One of them is just to I hope convey \\nsome of my own excitement a bout machine learning to you.  \\nThe second goal is by the end of this class, I hope all of you will be ab le to apply state-of-\\nthe-art machine learning algorithms to whatev er problems you're interested in. And if you \\never need to build a system for reading zi p codes, you'll know how to do that by the end \\nof this class.  \\nAnd lastly, by the end of this class, I reali ze that only a subset of  you are interested in \\ndoing research in machine learning, but by the c onclusion of this class,  I hope that all of \\nyou will actually be well qualified to star t doing research in machine learning, okay?  \\nSo let's say a few words about logistics. The prerequisites of this class are written on one \\nof the handouts, are as follows: In this class, I'm going to assume that all of you have sort \\nof basic knowledge of computer science and kn owledge of the basic computer skills and \\nprinciples. So I assume all of you know what big?O notation, that all of you know about\\n\\ninto his office and he said, \\\"Oh, professo r, professor, thank you so much for your \\nmachine learning class. I learned so much from it. There's this stuff that I learned in your \\nclass, and I now use every day. And it's help ed me make lots of money, and here's a \\npicture of my big house.\\\"  \\nSo my friend was very excited. He said, \\\"W ow. That's great. I'm glad to hear this \\nmachine learning stuff was actually useful. So what was it that you learned? Was it \\nlogistic regression? Was it the PCA? Was it the data ne tworks? What was it that you \\nlearned that was so helpful?\\\" And the student said, \\\"Oh, it was the MATLAB.\\\"  \\nSo for those of you that don't know MATLAB yet, I hope you do learn it. It's not hard, \\nand we'll actually have a short MATLAB tutori al in one of the discussion sections for \\nthose of you that don't know it.  \\nOkay. The very last piece of logistical th ing is the discussion s ections. So discussion \\nsections will be taught by the TAs, and atte ndance at discussion sections is optional, \\nalthough they'll also be recorded and televi sed. And we'll use the discussion sections \\nmainly for two things. For the next two or th ree weeks, we'll use the discussion sections \\nto go over the prerequisites to this class or if some of you haven't seen probability or \\nstatistics for a while or maybe algebra, we'll go over those in the discussion sections as a \\nrefresher for those of you that want one.\"\n",

      "    \"System: Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question. \\nIf you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\\n----------------\\nof this class will not be very program ming intensive, although we will do some \\nprogramming, mostly in either MATLAB or Octa ve. I'll say a bit more about that later.  \\nI also assume familiarity with basic proba bility and statistics. So most undergraduate \\nstatistics class, like Stat 116 taught here at Stanford, will be more than enough. I'm gonna \\nassume all of you know what ra ndom variables are, that all of you know what expectation \\nis, what a variance or a random variable is. And in case of some of you, it's been a while \\nsince you've seen some of this material. At some of the discussion sections, we'll actually \\ngo over some of the prerequisites, sort of as  a refresher course under prerequisite class. \\nI'll say a bit more about that later as well.  \\nLastly, I also assume familiarity with basi c linear algebra. And again, most undergraduate \\nlinear algebra courses are more than enough. So if you've taken courses like Math 51, \\n103, Math 113 or CS205 at Stanford, that would be more than enough. Basically, I'm \\ngonna assume that all of you know what matrix es and vectors are, that you know how to \\nmultiply matrices and vectors and multiply matrix and matrices, that you know what a matrix inverse is. If you know what an eigenvect or of a matrix is, that'd be even better. \\nBut if you don't quite know or if you're not qu ite sure, that's fine, too. We'll go over it in \\nthe review sections.\\n\\nstatistics for a while or maybe algebra, we'll go over those in the discussion sections as a \\nrefresher for those of you that want one.  \\nLater in this quarter, we'll also use the disc ussion sections to go over extensions for the \\nmaterial that I'm teaching in the main lectur es. So machine learning is a huge field, and \\nthere are a few extensions that we really want  to teach but didn't have time in the main \\nlectures for.\\n\\nSo, see, most of us use learning algorithms half a dozen, a dozen, maybe dozens of times \\nwithout even knowing it.  \\nAnd of course, learning algorithms are also  doing things like giving us a growing \\nunderstanding of the human genome. So if so meday we ever find a cure for cancer, I bet \\nlearning algorithms will have had a large role in that. That's sort of the thing that Tom \\nworks on, yes?  \\nSo in teaching this class, I sort of have thre e goals. One of them is just to I hope convey \\nsome of my own excitement a bout machine learning to you.  \\nThe second goal is by the end of this class, I hope all of you will be ab le to apply state-of-\\nthe-art machine learning algorithms to whatev er problems you're interested in.
